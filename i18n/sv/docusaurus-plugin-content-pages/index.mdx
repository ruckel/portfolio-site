> DevOps-orienterad full stack-utvecklare med fokus på automation, CI/CD, and reproducerbar infrastruktur.  
Jag bygger pålitliga system med verktyg som GitHub Actions, Firebase, Google Cloud och NixOS, med ett starkt intresse för Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) och deklarativa konfigurationer.  
Mitt arbetsflöde inkluderar att skapa underhållbara arbetsflöden, återanvändbara mallar och att effektivisera arbetet för arbetsgrupper genom tydlig dokumentation och standardisering av processer.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

I am a DevOps-oriented full-stack and backend developer focused on automation, maintainability, and reproducible infrastructure. I work extensively with CI/CD pipelines, Google Cloud, Firebase, GitHub Actions, and Nix/NixOS. I value Infrastructure as Code and use NixOS to build declarative and version-controlled systems professionally, in my homelab and my workstations.

My work centers on creating reliable engineering processes: deployment automation, pipeline standardization, development workflow design, code review practices, and technical documentation. I also design templates, shared utilities, and reusable functions that significantly reduce repetitive work for teams.

<h2>About</h2>

I am currently a system developer working on full-stack web applications using React, Firebase, and Google Cloud. I build and maintain CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions and design development workflows for small teams. I lead interns, teach JavaScript to developers with Java backgrounds, introduce Git/GitHub workflows, and manage issue tracking using GitHub Projects.

In my free time, I focus on infrastructure, DevOps, and reproducibility through a NixOS-based homelab. I use Nix and NixOS both as learning platforms and as practical tools for Infrastructure as Code. This includes declarative service definitions, automated rebuilds, GitOps-style updates, and experiments with reproducible development environments. These habits reinforce my professional work by giving me a deeper understanding of system reliability, automation, and deployment strategies.

<h3>My interests include:</h3>

- DevOps, SRE fundamentals, platform engineering
- Backend engineering with Java, Node.js, Firebase Functions
- CI/CD automation, GitOps workflows, test-first deployments
- Declarative infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code (Nix, NixOS)
- Full-stack development in smaller teams where architectural decisions matter

<h2>Homelab</h2>

I maintain a NixOS- and Linux-based homelab designed to test and explore DevOps practices in a safe, controlled environment. This includes:

- Declarative NixOS configurations for services, networking, containers, and user environments
- Infrastructure as Code principles applied through NixOS modules and reproducible builds
- GitOps-style updates and rollback-capable system deployments
- Self-hosted services for automation, monitoring, and experimentation
- Rebuilding and migrating systems to understand failure scenarios, reliability, and maintainability
- Self-hosted Nextcloud with CalDAV to support a degoogled phone setup, combined with Netbird VPN for secure remote access to files and internal services

This setup gives me hands-on experience with reliability, security, reproducibility, and system design. Skills directly applicable to modern DevOps and platform engineering roles.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Reusable CI/CD Pipeline Templates (GitHub Actions → Firebase/GCP)</h3>


I design pipelines that can be dropped into new repos with minimal changes. These templates standardize build steps, environment configuration, testing, and deployment. This eliminates repeated work, reduces onboarding time, and ensures consistent pipeline quality across teams.

<h3>React + Firebase Web Application (Lead Developer + Mentor)</h3>
As the lead developer, I introduced the architecture, CI/CD pipeline, branching strategy, and documentation. I guided two groups of interns through JavaScript fundamentals, React development, Git workflows, and team-based development practices.

<h3>NixOS Infrastructure & Systems Repository</h3>
A fully declarative configuration repository used for reproducible systems, code-based configuration, automated rebuilds, and service provisioning. Useful both for personal infrastructure and as a demonstration of Infrastructure as Code.

<h3>Homelab Automation and Service Deployments</h3>
Self-hosted services, monitoring setups, CI/CD experiments, and Nix-based declarative automation. Used to test new technologies and understand operational behavior in a realistic environment.
