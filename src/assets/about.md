It took me a few years to decide what I wanted to be when I grow up.


After spending my high school going from computer science to music
production and live audio followed by a few internships in the field
I realized that music was too much of a passion for me to compete in
the market. Now I am back to computers, or studying how to
manipulate them. I have always been somewhat of a nerd.


# a few points that makes me, me:

#### I am a huge music nerd
Every year I keep ==racking up== **100 000**+ *minutes* on my Spotify wrapped
and I own more music instruments than I am willing to openly admit.

#### International mindset
Expats in Sweden connect well with me. I connect well with expats.
More than once I have become their &quot;in between&quot; when they
experience nordic behaviour and culture.


#### My dream: Travel by living - with a base in Stockholm
I want to see as much of the world as possible. But not as a
tourist. As a local. Being able to spend 3+ months in a place while
working seems like the perfect way to achieve this.


#### Open source aficionado
Openly auditable services and products are important to create trust and transparency.


#### Design minded
Good design makes a service or product intuitive. Intuition is a powerful tool.

#### Privacy concious
Swedes usually looks at me as if I am about to put on a tin foil hat
whenever I mention privacy. But I am not, I just try to adapt to a
somewhat privacy conscious lifestyle.
